## Introduction
[Esteroids](https://esteroids.eth.limo) is a search engine for the decentralized web. It also includes tools for browsing which dWebsite the decentralized web has to offer. Esteroids is a decentralized website itself, based on ENS and IPNS (New  to decentralized web, read this first: [Intro to dWebsites](http://blog.almonit.eth.link/2020-05-21/Introduction_to_Dwebsitse.html)).


## Web App
This repository contains the source code of the web app that is the basis of [esteroids.eth](https://esteroids.eth.limo).

Esteroids Web App is a React App. It has client side only, does not rely on any backend, and is meant for users to search the decentralized web in complete privacy.

## Installation
To install all the dependencies run:

```yarn```

Then you can run the webapp locally with:

```yarn start``` 

or build a static version of it with: 

```yarn build```

## Versioning
Esteroids App versioning consists of three letters, in the form `Vx.y.z`, where

- a change of `x` is done in case of a new milestone,
- a change of `y` is done in case of a new major feature,
- a change of `z` is done in case of new small features, patches, or bug fixes.

The first version is `V0.1.0` marking the beta version of Esteroids App. The reason we begin from Beta is due to the fact that Esteroids App Alpha had a different code base.
